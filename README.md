# par-tables
As inspired from RAWK. 

Server side calls the lovely fellas at football-data.org with the latest points. 

Compares with teams positions (currently hardcoded) and calculates pars.


# Improvement / Development ideas
User-defined standings.
Odds integration.
User Profile and favorite configuration
Rolling table par calculation
Externalize mongodb instance (and perhaps actually use it)
... many many more from RAWK

# Running the application.
